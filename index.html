        <p><strong>AT 22 YEARS, HE WAS THE YOUNGEST BOXER TO UNSEAT A REIGNING HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION</strong> This made Clay the top contender to challenge Sonny Liston for boxing’s World Heavyweight Championship. Liston was a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. And as Clay hadn’t been at his best in his last few fights, the odds were stacked against him 7–1, making him the underdog. The fight took place on February 25, 1964. After a close beginning, Clay dominated the sixth round hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston didn’t turn up for the seventh round and Clay was declared winner by technical knockout (TKO). The victory made Cassius Clay, at age 22, the youngest boxer to unseat a reigning heavyweight champion. Moreover, Sports Illustrated magazine ranked Clay’s victory as the fourth greatest sports moment of the 20th century.

        <p><strong>HE FOUGHT THE FIGHT OF THE CENTURY AGAINST JOE FRAZIER</strong> oon after the Liston fight, Clay publicly converted to Islam and took the name Muhammad Ali. After his refusal to be inducted into the armed forces, Ali was not allowed to fight from March 1967 to October 1970. In Ali’s absence, Joe Frazier had collected two championship belts through knockouts. Thus when Ali returned, it set the stage for a fight between him and Frazier with both having a legitimate claim to the title of World Heavyweight Champion. Moreover, both Muhammad Ali (31–0, 25 KOs) and Joe Frazier (26–0, 23 KOs) were undefeated making it the first time that two undefeated boxers fought each other for the heavyweight title. There was a massive promotional hype for the fight and it exceeded even those expectations. Held on March 8, 1971 at Madison Square Garden, it lasted the full 15-round championship distance and was very closely fought. However, in the end, Frazier retained his title with a unanimous decision handing Ali his first professional defeat. Nonetheless Ali became part of what has been termed as the Fight of the Century and been rated by many as the biggest sporting event in history.

        <p><strong>HE WON THE RUMBLE IN THE JUNGLE AGAINST GEORGE FOREMAN</strong> Joe Frazier lost his title to George Foreman. This set up a non-title boxing match between Ali and Frazier known as Super Fight II. It took place on January 28, 1974 at the same venue as their previous fight. Muhammad Ali went on to win this fight by a unanimous decision. Ali’s defeat of Frazier set the stage for a fight between Ali and George Foreman, considered by many as one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. Known as The Rumble in the Jungle, this historic boxing event took place on October 30, 1974 in Kinshasa, Zaire. Ali came into the fight as a 4–1 underdog but won by knockout, putting Foreman down just before the end of the eighth round. The Rumble in the Jungle is also famous for Ali’s introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic, in which he leaned against the ropes and absorbed punches from his opponent. This decreased his chances of being caught with a clean blow and at the same time tired his opponent. The Rumble in the Jungle has also been called “arguably the greatest sporting event of the 20th century”. By winning it, Ali became the world heavyweight champion for a second time.

        <p><strong>HIS REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN THE VIETNAM WAR MADE HIM AN ICON FOR MANY PEOPLE</strong> In 1967, Muhammad Ali shocked the world when he refused to report after being drafted into the US military. The reasons he cited for his action was his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. He also pointed out that Black men were disproportionally drafted and killed in Vietnam, while those who returned after fighting heroically still faced racism in their own country. At the trial on June 20, 1967, the jury found Ali guilty of draft evasion. He was stripped of his boxing title and was banned from boxing. Ali’s stance was controversial as well as brave because there was widespread support for the Vietnam War at the time. However, with time, Ali’s actions as a conscientious objector to the war made him an icon for countless black Americans and others. Moreover, Muhammad Ali was also a high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement. On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Ali’s conviction by a unanimous verdict.</p>

        <p><strong>MUHAMMAD ALI IS WIDELY REGARDED AS ONE OF THE GREATEST ATHLETES OF 20TH CENTURY</strong> Muhammad Ali is regarded by boxing commentators and historians as one of the greatest fighters of all time. He was named “The Ring Magazine Fighter of the Year” a record six times. In 1990, Ali was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. In 1998, Ring Magazine named him number 1 in its ranking of greatest heavyweights from all eras. In 1999, The Associated Press voted Ali the No. 1 heavyweight of the 20th century. In 2007, ESPN ranked him second in its choice of the greatest heavyweight fighter of all time, behind Joe Louis. In 1999, Ali was named the “Greatest Heavyweight Boxer of all Time” and “The Greatest Athlete of the 20th Century” by the popular magazine Sports Illustrated. The same year, in a poll conducted by the BBC, Muhammad Ali was named the Sports Personality of the Century. He accumulated more votes than the combined total of the five other contenders: Pele, George Best, Donald Bradman, Jack Nicklaus, and Jesse Owens. In 2015, Sports Illustrated renamed its “Sportsman Legacy Award” to the “Sports Illustrated’s Muhammad Ali Legacy Award” to honor his boxing and social achievements.</p>

        <p><strong>FLOAT LIKE A BUTTERFLY, STING LIKE A BEE</strong> The boxing style of Ali was highly unorthodox for a heavyweight. He never relied on overpowering punches. Instead he relied on his superior hand speed, quick reflexes and constant movement. Ali often danced and circled around his opponents holding his hands low. This led to his opponents chasing him and throwing themselves off balance in an attempt to hit him as he appeared to be an open target. However they often missed and left them exposed to Ali’s counter punches. This was precisely how Sonny Liston was hit and knocked out by Ali in their second fight. Professional boxer Floyd Patterson said this about Ali’s movements: “It’s very hard to hit a moving target, and (Ali) moved all the time, with such grace, three minutes of every round for fifteen rounds. He never stopped. It was extraordinary.” Also, the strong footwork of Ali made it almost impossible for his opponents to cut down the ring and corner him against the ropes. The boxing style of Muhammad Ali is epitomized by his own catchphrase: “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”.</p>
